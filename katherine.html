          <h2>
            American Mathematician
          </h2>
        
          <p>One of the first Black women to serve as a NASA scientist was Katherine Johnson, a mathematician. She computed and examined the NASA spacecraft's flight routes as a mathematician.Her calculations enabled the first Americans to leave Earth's orbit and land on the moon, for which she is most known.Glenn instructed engineers to "get the girl"—Johnson—to manually run the same numbers through the same equations that had been entered into the computer on her desktop mechanical calculator as part of the preflight checklist. Katherine Johnson recalled the astronaut stating, "If she thinks they're good, then I'm ready to leave." The success of Glenn's flight signaled a turning point in the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union.Johnson would mention the calculations that assisted in synchronizing Project Apollo's Lunar Module with the lunar-orbiting Command and Service Module when asked to name her greatest contribution to space exploration. Along with 26 research publications, she also contributed to the Space Shuttle and the Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS, subsequently called Landsat). She spent 33 years at Langley before retiring in 1986.  Johnson received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, from President Barack Obama in 2015, adding yet another remarkable accomplishment to her extensive list.
            Feb. 24, 2020 marked her passing.
