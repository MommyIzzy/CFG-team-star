    <h2>
  Polish Scientist
</h2>
      <p>Marie Skoldowska-Curie, a Polish scientist, is perhaps one of science's most well-known figures. She was born in Warsaw, Poland, but subsequently emigrated to France, where she discovered a remarkable discovery that would alter the course of history. She met her spouse, a scientist as well, in France. Together, they improved upon earlier research and developed findings that led to their being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1903.Marie went on to win another Nobel Prize in 1911, as if that weren't enough. She was the first female winner ever.All of this may sound pretty scientific, but the Curies reported the discovery of two new chemical elements—polonium and radium—through their efforts.
        The Curies produced revolutionary findings about a phenomenon known as radioactivity. When a component of some specific chemical elements called their nucleus breaks down, radioactivity results. These energetic particles are released. The development of X-rays, which are essential in modern hospitals, was also greatly aided by these findings.You now know who to thank if you ever find yourself in the hospital for an X-ray.</p>
