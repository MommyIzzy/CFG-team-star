            American Activist
          </h2>
        
          <p>When she refused to give up her seat to a white man on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama in 1955, Rosa Parks (1913â€“2005) played a key role in the beginning of the civil rights movement in the United States. Her acts served as motivation for the local Black community's leaders to plan the Montgomery Bus Boycott. The boycott, which was organized by a young Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., lasted over a year and resulted in Parks losing her employment during that time. It was only declared successful when the U.S. Supreme Court determined that bus segregation was unconstitutional. Over the course of the last 50 years, Rosa Parks rose to national prominence as a symbol of courage and dignity in the fight to abolish ingrained racial discrimination.
            Parks was found guilty of breaking the segregation regulations on December 5 and received a suspended sentence, a $10 fine, and $4 in court expenses. Black boycott participants were also considerably more numerous than even the most optimistic members of the community had imagined. Nixon and a few clergymen made the decision to capitalize on the momentum and established the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA) to oversee the boycott. They chose Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who had recently moved to Montgomery and was just 26 years old, to lead the MIA.
